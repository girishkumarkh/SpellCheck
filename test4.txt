Two
budding
computer
scientists
joined
Cardiff
University
President
Professor
Sir
Martin
Evans
last
week
to
celebrate
projects
completed
as
part
of
the
Nuffield
Bursary
Scheme
Grace
Jones
and
Michael
Johns
collected
certificates
from
Sir
Martin
for
their
project
Analysing
Facial
Movement
with
3D
which
they
worked
on
with
Professor
Dave
Marshall
from
the
School
of
Computer
Science
Informatics
The
project
which
was
completed
during
a
summer
placement
within
the
School
focused
on
the
creation
of
a
database
detailing
facial
movement
analysis
to
be
used
by
the
worldwide
research
community
The
students
both
from
Gower
College
in
Swansea
used
a
3D
video
camera
to
research
how
peoples
faces
change
dynamically
when
talking
and
smiling
The
aim
of
the
research
which
is
ongoing
is
to
develop
realistic
models
of
facial
dynamics
for
a
variety
of
applications
including
Computer
Graphics
Film
and
Animation
The
tools
developed
will
also
help
those
working
in
medical
and
psychological
fields
determine
the
normalities
and
abnormailities
in
facial
expressions
which
will
assist
in
surgical
planning
and
could
aid
in
the
diagnosis
of
the
early
onset
of
certain
motor/neuron
diseases
Future
research
will
include
inviting
people
back
to
repeat
the
process
allowing
the
team
to
monitor
the
affects
of
aging
and
how
this
impacts
on
the
way
we
say
certain
words
The
Nuffield
Bursary
Scheme
allows
students
to
work
alongside
practicing
scientists
technologists
engineers
and
mathematicians
giving
them
an
insight
into
the
world
of
research
and
development
